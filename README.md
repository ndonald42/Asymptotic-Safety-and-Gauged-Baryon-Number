# Asymptotic Safety and Gauged Baryon Number
We consider a model with gauged baryon number that may be rendered asymptotically safe when gravitational effects above the Planck scale are taken into account. We study the ultraviolet fixed points in this theory and determine the restrictions on the parameter space of the model at the TeV scale following from the requirement that the asymptotic fixed points are reached. Assuming that the new gauge symmetry is broken at the TeV scale, we comment on the phenomenological implications of these restrictions.
# File 1: Gaussian fixed point renormalization group evolution of all couplings
RGEs are generated from PyR@TE3 software in C++. This python file first solves the system of coupled differential equations below the Planck scale where gravitational corrections can be ignored and uses initial conditions specified in the Gaussian fixed-point case. The values of the couplings at the Planck scale are then used to set the initial conditions for the RGEs above the Planck scale with the gravitational corrections now taken into account. Plots of the running of the couplings above and below the Planck scale are produced for the couplings in each sector of the model.
