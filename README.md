# Asymptotic Safety and Gauged Baryon Number
We consider a model with gauged baryon number that may be rendered asymptotically safe when gravitational effects above the Planck scale are taken into account. We study the ultraviolet fixed points in this theory and determine the restrictions on the parameter space of the model at the TeV scale following from the requirement that the asymptotic fixed points are reached. Assuming that the new gauge symmetry is broken at the TeV scale, we comment on the phenomenological implications of these restrictions.
